# The data donation task

This branch is for the study of Quyang Zhao where donation of TikTok data is combined with an eye-tracking task.

The data donation task (a fork of [Feldspar](https://github.com/eyra/feldspar)) is a front end that guides participants through the data donation steps, used in conjunction with Next.
Next is a software as a service platform developed by [Eyra](https://eyra.co/) to facilitate scientific research.

For detailed tutorials and API reference, see the [documentation site](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/).

### What's new in v3.0.0

Platform extraction is now config-driven: each platform has a `configs/<platform>_config.json` that declares table titles, column headers, and visualizations. Generate one with `pnpm generate-config <platform>`. The generator refuses to overwrite existing files, protecting researcher edits. `release.sh` auto-discovers platforms from `configs/` — no hardcoded list needed. `VITE_PLATFORM` is now required in dev mode.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes and the migration notes for downstream forks.

## Installation and local testing

### Pre-requisites

- Fork or clone this repo
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

### Setup

```sh
pnpm install
cd packages/python && poetry install
```

### Check environment

```sh
pnpm doctor
```

### Start local dev server

```sh
VITE_PLATFORM=example pnpm start
```

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Commands

### Development

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_PLATFORM=<platform> pnpm start` | Start dev server with hot reload |
| `pnpm generate-config <platform>` | Generate `configs/<platform>_config.json` from extractor docstrings |
| `pnpm run build` | Full production build (Python wheel + feldspar + data-collector) |
| `pnpm doctor` | Check environment setup (13 checks) |

### Testing & Type Checking

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test` | Run Python tests |
| `pnpm test:py` | Same as above |
| `pnpm test:py -- tests/test_specific.py -q` | Run specific tests |
| `pnpm typecheck:py` | Run Pyright type checker |
| `pnpm verify:py` | Run both tests + type checks |

### Releases

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm release` | Build one zip per platform (auto-discovered from `configs/`) |
| `VITE_PLATFORM=<platform> pnpm release` | Build a release zip for a single platform |

Releases are created in `releases/`.

## Working with platforms

Generate a config for a platform, then edit it to suit your study:

```sh
pnpm generate-config instagram
# edit packages/python/port/configs/instagram_config.json
```

To add a new platform, copy `packages/python/port/platforms/example.py` as your starting point.

See the [documentation site](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/) for full tutorials.

## Architecture

See `docs/decisions/` for architectural decision records. Key structure:

```
packages/
  python/         Python extraction scripts (per-platform)
  feldspar/       Workflow UI framework (upstream Eyra)
  data-collector/ Host app / dev server with custom UI components
```

### Platform extraction flow

Each platform (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) has a `FlowBuilder` subclass in `packages/python/port/platforms/` that handles:

1. File prompt → participant uploads DDP zip
2. Validation → DDP category detection via `DDP_CATEGORIES`
3. Extraction → `ZipArchiveReader` reads files from cached archive inventory
4. Consent → participant reviews extracted tables
5. Donation → data sent to host platform

### Supported platforms

LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Netflix, ChatGPT, WhatsApp, X, Chrome
